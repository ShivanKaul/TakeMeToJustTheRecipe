# README

Get just the recipe (and none of the lengthy life story) from a recipe website. Once installed, simply click the extension icon (a cute little whisk) and it'll open the current page in [justtherecipe.app](justtherecipe.app).
Credit for [justtherecipe.app](justtherecipe.app) goes to Reddit user [u/doppio](https://www.reddit.com/user/doppio/). This extension just opens the current page on [justtherecipe.app](justtherecipe.app).

I'm not affiliated with the creator of [justtherecipe.app](justtherecipe.app), just wanted an easy way to access the excellent website.
