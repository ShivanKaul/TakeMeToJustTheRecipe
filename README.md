Get just the recipe from a recipe website by opening it in justtherecipe.app.
Credit for justtherecipe.app goes to Reddit user [u/doppio](https://www.reddit.com/user/doppio/). This extension just opens the current page on justtherecipe.app.

I'm not affiliated with the creator of justtherecipe.app, just wanted an easy way to access the excellent website.

## Develop
`npm install` to install `browserify`.
`npm run build` to build the extension.
Totally didn't need `browserify` for this, just have a template lying around.
